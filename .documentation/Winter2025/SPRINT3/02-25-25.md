# Sprint Update - Tuesday, February 25th

### Attendance:
- **ALL**

### Sprint Goal Restated
Students will be able to practice dynamically generated Confidence Interval and Experimental Statistics problems. Teachers will be able to see what problems their students have finished. Students will be able to select their teacher.


### Votes:

#### First of Five Votes:
| Person   | First Vote | Explanation (First Vote)                                               |
|----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dhruv    |  5         |  Based on stories, he thinks we can get the sprint done                       |
| Nick   |    3       | There is a lot of actual implementation, plan seems less clear       |
| Kevin    |  3         |  User stories seem harder, and sees some time constraints arising             |
| Vivek   |  4         |  Actual implementation might turn out to be difficult, espcially with database, but some stories are similar                                 |

#### Second of Five Votes:
| Person   | Second Vote | Explanation (Second Vote)                                             |

| Dhruv    | 4           | Hearing about backend could be challenging                                                                        |

| Kevin    | 3           | Same reasoning | 
| Vivek   | 4           |  Same reasoning                                                                       |

### Actionable Plan
3 votes needs explanation: Team needs to meet an extra time to look at proposed database schema that will help with many tasks


#### Current Tasks:
- **Dhruv:** Students choose a teacher, has been waiting on database structure for guidance
- **Nick:** Has been making database schema, just needs to verify some things with team fully
- **Kevin:** View which problems a student has done, has been waiting on database structure for guidance
- **Vivek:** Experimental statistics problems, has been waiting on database structure for guidance
