### Actionable Plan
**Nick:**  
Needs more chores to deal with existing bugs. They should be added into the storyboard so that visually it’s easier to understand how much work is to be done.  
- Question category inconsistency  
- Routing issues  
- Some answer boxes don’t fill in  
- Styling issues  
- Editing and showing  
- Student deletion in student management redirection is incorrect.  

**Developer will send all the bugs they find in bullets into the slack channel.**
