| Nick     |    4       |  Finished tasks strongly/the result worked well from seeding and fixing bugs                  |
| Kevin    |    4       |  Has made a lot of progress recently and is confident this will continue                  |
| Vivek    |    4       |  Doing one question generation story was easy so the next should be similar code; rubocop has been harder to fix                  |
