# Sprint Update - Tuesday, March 4th

### Attendance:
- **ALL**

### Sprint Goal Restated
Students will be able to practice dynamically generated Confidence Interval and Experimental Statistics problems. Teachers will be able to see what problems their students have finished. Students will be able to select their teacher.

### Votes:

#### First of Five Votes:
| Person   | First Vote | Explanation (First Vote)                                               |
|----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dhruv    |     3      |     His task is complex with database interactions which is taking longer than expected               |
| Nick     |     3      |     Took a while to do schema, which could have put people behind some                 |
| Kevin    |     3      |     Still a lot to do, somewhere between 3 and 4 since progress is being made                |
| Vivek    |     4      |     Is only 30 min away from first story completion, and can quickly do another he thinks     |

#### Second of Five Votes:
| Person   | Second Vote | Explanation (Second Vote)                                             |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dhruv    |      3        |    Same reasoning              |
| Nick     |      4       |    Rest of stories seem pretty doable that are left             |
| Kevin    |      3        |   Same reasoning                 | 
| Vivek    |      4       |    Same reasoning           |
 
### Actionable Plan
