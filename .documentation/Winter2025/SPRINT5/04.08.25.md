# Sprint Update - Tuesday, April 8th

### Attendance:
- **ALL**

### Sprint Goal Restated
Students will be able to manage details about themselves including email, full name, section, and teacher. Students will be able to effectively view answers as a separate function from submitting their answer.
Teachers will be able to manage and view students by new attributes such as semester, section, and email. Teachers will be able to see participation and category difficulty statistics.

### Votes:

#### First of Five Votes:
| Person | First Vote | Explanation (First Vote)                                               |
|--------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cooper | 4          | Most tasks are chores/fixes but there are still a relatively high number of tasks |
| Nick   | 3          | Some stories seem difficult even though there are a lot of relatively simple fixes. |
| Jordan | 4          | Beginning of sprint where features feel reasonable but don’t want to underestimate it. |
| Vivek  | 3          | Unsure where the team is at regarding tasks.                           |

### Actionable Plan
Generally, we are lacking an understanding of what needs to be done. Time estimates are vague so I need to clean up the storyboard and user story/chore acceptance criteria to better this for the next meeting.

Nick: Having the product board better organized would help raise his confidence for this sprint.
Vivek: Also needs better context for other team members

#### Current Tasks:
- **Cooper:** Response Grading and Show Answer Fix
  - **Time Estimate:** 1hr
    - Features are implemented but need line coverage. 1 hr
