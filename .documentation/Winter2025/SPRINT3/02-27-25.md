# Sprint Update - Thursday, February 27th

### Attendance:
- **ALL**

### Sprint Goal Restated
Students will be able to practice dynamically generated Confidence Interval and Experimental Statistics problems. Teachers will be able to see what problems their students have finished. Students will be able to select their teacher.

### Votes:

#### First of Five Votes:
| Person   | First Vote | Explanation (First Vote)                                               |
|----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dhruv    |    4       | Thinks database will be difficult, after that should not be too bad                       |
| Nick     |    4       | Worried about some database errors, but after that should be okay                       |
| Kevin    |    3       | Has some outside time constraints on top of stories being more difficult                        |
| Vivek    |    3       | Got far into problem generation, but it is taking a lot longer to develop than expected            |

#### Second of Five Votes:
| Person   | Second Vote | Explanation (Second Vote)                                             |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dhruv    |     4       |   Same reasoning                    |
| Nick     |     4       |   Same reasoning                    |
| Kevin    |     3        |  Same reasoning                     | 
| Vivek    |     4        | Problem generation won't be too concerned with DB which was most other people's worries              |
